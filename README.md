## Getting started with Verilog, FPGAs and PLDs

### Verilog

### FPGAs

### What's next?

This guide is designed to introduce you to the world of Hardware Description Languages. We'll be getting started with fundamentals that help you to understand how Verilog synthesises to FPGA logic and how such devices can be incredibly powerful and valuable for their low level implementation.
